# Sudoku
Wondered how sudoku puzzles were made and I found out. Generic Sudoku but no undo button because I don't want/know how to program it. <br>
It gets a random start of 5 or so numbers <br>
Brute forces the solution <br>
Then removes numbers with opposite positions <br> <br>
There is most likely a better way to brute force the solution but it works.

The "Release" folder has the Sudoku executable and the necessary resources.
